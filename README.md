Before you get started with this project, below are the necessary points to keep in mind:
- first, visit the 'handtrackingbasic.py' to get a generalised idea about how we are going through the project
- next, move on to the 'HandTrackingModule.py' where the dummy code is present. That code can be used multiple times in different projects for serving various purposes.
- lastly, check the 'handGestureVolumeControl.py' to control your device volume using hand gestures.
- keep all your files under one single folder

Key points:
- install all the following necessary libraries for the code to function correctly.
1. opencv--------------------pip install opencv-python
2. mediapipe-----------------pip install mediapipe
- here we will use only the 'hands' model for palm detection and hand landmarks. get the necessary information at https://google.github.io/mediapipe/solutions/hands.html
3. pycaw---------------------pip install pycaw
